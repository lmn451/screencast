Product Requirements Document: CaptureCast Browser Extension
Author: Lead Product Architect
Status: Draft
Version: 1.0
Date: May 21, 2024
1. Vision & Mission
Vision: To provide the simplest, most reliable way for users to capture and share their screen activity directly from their web browser.
Mission: To build a lightweight, privacy-focused, and high-performance browser extension for effortless screen recording, starting with a core, screen-only MVP
2. Target Audience & User Personas
Developer Dan: A software developer who needs to record bug reproductions, create short demos of new features for pull requests, or share technical walkthroughs with his team. He values high-quality output, low performance overhead, and speed.
Support Specialist Sarah: A customer support agent who needs to create quick, visual guides for customers to show them how to use a product or troubleshoot an issue. She values simplicity and a "one-click" workflow.
QA Tester Quinn: A quality assurance tester who needs to document bugs and testing flows with video evidence. They value reliability and clear, uncompromised recordings of their interactions.
3. Goals & Success Metrics
Goal	Success Metrics
Deliver a simple MVP	- Time from extension install to first successful recording is under 60 seconds.<br>- 99% of recording sessions complete without error.
Achieve high performance	- CPU usage during recording remains below 15% on a modern mid-range laptop.<br>- The extension's memory footprint is under 100MB.
Gain user adoption	- Achieve 1,000+ weekly active users within 3 months of launch.<br>- Maintain a 4.5+ star rating on the Chrome Web Store.
Ensure user privacy	- Zero data is sent to any external server. All processing is done locally.<br>- Clear visual indicators show when a recording is active.
4. Product Scope & Features
Phase 1: MVP (Screen Recording Only)
The focus is on delivering a rock-solid, simple, and reliable core experience.
| Feature ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria - |
| CC-01 | As a user, I want to start a screen recording with minimal clicks. | - Clicking the extension icon opens a simple UI.<br>- The UI presents options to record: "This Tab", "Entire Screen", or "Application Window".<br>- Selecting an option immediately starts the browser's native screen sharing prompt. |
| CC-02 | As a user, I want clear controls to manage my recording. | - Once recording starts, the extension icon changes to a "recording" state (e.g., a red dot).<br>- Clicking the icon during a recording shows a "Stop Recording" button.<br>- A small, persistent on-screen overlay also shows a "Stop" button. |
| CC-03 | As a user, I want to easily save my recording when I'm finished. | - Clicking "Stop" immediately ends the recording.<br>- A new browser tab opens with a preview of the recorded video.<br>- A prominent "Download" button is displayed.<br>- Clicking "Download" saves the video to the user's default download folder as a .webm file. |
Phase 2: Audio & Webcam Integration
CC-04: Add an option to include microphone audio in the recording.
CC-05: Add an option to include webcam video as a picture-in-picture overlay.
CC-06: Update the initial UI to allow users to toggle Screen, Microphone, and Webcam sources before starting.
Phase 3: Advanced Features & Editing (Leveraging WebAssembly)
CC-07: In-browser Trimming: Allow users to trim the start and end of their recordings on the preview page before downloading. This is an ideal use case for ffmpeg.wasm.
CC-08: Format Conversion: Add an option to download the recording as a .mp4 or animated .gif. This transcoding would be powered by ffmpeg.wasm running locally in the browser.
CC-09: Annotations: Allow users to draw on the screen during a recording.
5. Technical Architecture Overview
Core Technology (Phase 1)
The MVP will rely exclusively on standard, highly-optimized, and secure browser APIs. This avoids unnecessary complexity and ensures maximum performance and stability.
Screen Capture: navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia() API. This is the modern standard for screen capturing, which handles user permissions and source selection (tab, window, screen).
Recording & Encoding: MediaRecorder API. This native browser API is incredibly efficient. It takes the MediaStream from getDisplayMedia() and encodes it into a video file (typically .webm with VP8/VP9 codec) using the browser's optimized, often hardware-accelerated, internal encoders.
Frontend: Standard HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript for the extension's popup and preview page.
Packaging: A standard WebExtension manifest.json file, configured for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
The Role of WebAssembly (Phase 3 and beyond)
While WASM is not the right tool for the initial capture and recording (as native browser APIs are far more efficient for that), it is the perfect technology for advanced, in-browser video processing.
Why not WASM for recording? The browser's MediaRecorder is already a highly optimized native implementation. Replicating its functionality in WASM would mean manually grabbing raw video frames, passing them to a WASM-compiled encoder (like ffmpeg.wasm), and muxing them into a container. This would be significantly less performant and more CPU-intensive than the native API.
Why WASM for editing/transcoding? For tasks like trimming, concatenating clips, or changing video formats (e.g., WebM to MP4), we need a full video processing library. ffmpeg.wasm allows us to run the entire FFmpeg suite directly and safely in the user's browser. This enables powerful, serverless video manipulation while maintaining our commitment to user privacy.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The recording process must have minimal impact on system performance to ensure smooth recordings.
Security & Privacy: All recording and processing must happen 100% on the client-side. No user data or video content will ever be transmitted to a server. The extension will only request the minimum permissions necessary to function.
Usability: The user interface must be clean, intuitive, and require no tutorial. The core workflow should be discoverable within seconds.
Compatibility: The extension must be fully functional on the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
7. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy - |
| Browser API changes or deprecation | Medium | High | - Adhere strictly to the WebExtensions standard.<br>- Maintain a suite of automated tests to catch breaking changes early.<br>- Monitor browser release notes for upcoming API changes. |
| Performance issues on lower-end hardware | Medium | Medium | - Stick to native APIs for the MVP to ensure maximum efficiency.<br>- Benchmark performance across a range of devices.<br>- Provide quality settings in future versions. |
| Low user adoption | High | High | - Focus on a flawless, simple, and reliable MVP experience.<br>- Actively solicit user feedback and iterate quickly.<br>- Ensure a clear and appealing Chrome Web Store listing. |
