# Privacy Policy for CaptureCast

Effective date: 2025-08-21

CaptureCast is a browser extension that records your screen locally in your browser to help you create and download screen recordings.

Information Collection and Use

- CaptureCast does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.
- All processing happens locally in your browser. Your recordings are stored temporarily in your browser's IndexedDB until you download them or delete them. You can delete recordings at any time from the preview page.

Permissions

- The extension requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function (activeTab, scripting, offscreen, tabs) in order to start/stop recordings, display a small in-page Stop button, and open a preview page.

Data Sharing

- CaptureCast does not share data with third parties.

Security

- Processing is performed within your browser’s sandbox. No data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share a file you downloaded.
